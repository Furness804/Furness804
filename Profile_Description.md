- 👋 Hi, I’m @Furness804
- 👀 I’m interested in railways, mapping, train simulators, map creators, stuff like www.scribblemaps.com, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an Intro to Game Development course - I use Construct3D to make projects. Currently, I'm working on a shooter game and I will hopefully upload the final version to that website's "arcade" page under the username Furness804.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I don't think that my minimal programming skills will be of much use to anyone.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't really know if anyone will want to contact me, but if I see any signs of people wanting to make contact, I will list method/s of contact in a new README file in the repository Furness804/Furness804.

Currently, I'm working on a shooter game in Construct3D and I will hopefully upload the final version to that website's "arcade" page under the username Furness804. A link to the uploaded version/s might also be added here on GitHub in a new repository.
