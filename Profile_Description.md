- 👋 Hi, I’m @Furness804
- 👀 I’m interested in railways, mapping, train simulators, map creators, stuff like www.scribblemaps.com, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I don't think that my minimal programming skills will be of much use to anyone.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't really know if anyone will want to contact me, but if I see any signs of people wanting to make contact, I will list method/s of contact here.
