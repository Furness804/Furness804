As I said I would in Furness804/Profile_Description, I have created this new file to list some ways to contact me.

My main method of communication is my Gmail. However, I rarely read my Gmail, so it'd be easier to just try and contact me here on Github.
I also have a YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/channel/furness804productions
